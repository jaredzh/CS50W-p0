                Hi there, my name is Jared Zhang and welcome to my personal website. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor
                studying Computer Science with an intended minor in Business. My hobbies include working out, investing, trying new food, and basketball.
                Outside of the classroom I'm part of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and I also work part-time at the campus 
                Tech Shop, formerly known as the Computer Showcase.
                <br>
                <br>I am seeking opportunities related to software engineering, machine learning, or fintech. I have experience working as an I.T. 
                intern and as a sales consultant. My strength include the ability to quickly adapt to changing conditions and learn new concepts on the go, 
                and a desire to find passion in the jobs that I perform. Please don't hesitate to reach out and contact me. I very much look forward to get to 
                know new people.
